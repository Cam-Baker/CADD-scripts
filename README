### Prerequisite

- conda
```bash
# can be installed like this
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -p $HOME/miniconda2 -b
export PATH=$HOME/miniconda2/bin:$PATH
```

*Note: You can also install CADD without conda by installing the dependencies otherwise. You can find the list of tools (VEP) and (python) libraries in the `src/environment.yml` file. In this case, you will also have to disable the line `source activate cadd-env` in `CADD.sh`*

### Setup

- load/move the zipped CADD archive to its destination folder and unzip.

```bash
unzip CADDv1.4.zip
```

- from here, you can either install everything seperately or run the script `install.sh` to install using a brief installation dialog (see below).

#### Install script

This is the easier way of installing CADD, just run:

```
./install.sh
```

You first state which parts you want to install (the environment as well as at least one genome build including annotation tracks are neccessary for a quick start) and the script should manage loading and unpacking the neccessary files.

#### Manual installation

Running CADD depends on three big building blocks (plus the repository containing this README which we assume you already downloaded):

 - dependencies
 - genome annotations
 - prescored variants

**Installing dependencies**

As stated already in the Prerequisite you can install CADD dependencies without conda, although we heavily recommend doing so. This is because managing the various parts becomes very handy by relying it. To setup the neccessary environment, we only need to run the command:

```bash
conda env create -f src/environment.yml
```

After the installing process (which will take a few minutes), the CADD conda environment will be loaded (via `source activate cadd-env` automatically in the `CADD.sh` script) and CADD can run without further settings.

**Installing annotations**

Both version of CADD (for the different genome builds) rely on a big number of genomic annotations. Depending on which genome build you require you can get them from our website (be careful where you put them as these are really big files and have identical filenames) via:

```bash
# for GRCh37 / hg19
wget -c http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/download/CADD/v1.4/annotationsGRCh37.tar.gz
# for GRCh38 / hg38
wget -c http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/download/CADD/v1.4/annotationsGRCh38.tar.gz
```

As those files are about 100 and 200 GB in size, downloads can take long (depending on your internet connection). We recommend to setup the process in the background and using a tool (like `wget -c` mentioned above) that allows you to continue an interrupted download.

To make sure you downloaded the files correctly, we recommend downloading md5 hash files from our website (e.g. `wget http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/download/CADD/v1.4/GRCh37/MD5SUMs`) and checking for completness (via `md5sum -c`).

The annotation files are finally put in the folder `data/annotations` and unpacked:

```bash
cd data/annotations
tar -zxvf annotationsGRCh37.tar.gz
tar -zxvf annotationsGRCh38.tar.gz
cd $OLDPWD
```

**Installing prescored files**

At this point you are ready to go, but if you want a faster version of CADD, you can download the prescored files from our website (see section Downloads for a list of available files). Please note that these files can be very big. The files are (together with their respective tabix indices) put in the folders `no_anno` or `incl_anno` depending on the file under `data/prescored/${GENOME_BUILD}/` and will be automatically detected by the `CADD.sh` script.

### Running CADD

You run CADD via the script `CADD.sh` which technically only requieres an either vcf or vcf.gz input file as last argument. You can further specify the genome build via `-g`, request a fully annotated output (`-a` flag) and specify a seperate output file via `-o` (else inputfile name `.tsv.gz` is used). I.e:

```bash
./CADD.sh input/test.vcf

./CADD.sh -a -g GRCh37 -o output.tsv.gz input/test.vcf
```
